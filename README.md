# [Project 1. Predicting Potential Customers ](https://github.com/Usanzimfura/Danny-Portofolio/blob/main/Potential_Customers_Prediction.ipynb)
Used Classification modelling to identify which leads are more likely to convert to paid custoers based on attributes of leads and their interaction details.

Used Python and Statistics to analyze a Food aggregator company data to get insight about the demands of different restaurants in order to to enhance the customer experience.

# [Project 3. Employee Attrition Prediction](https://github.com/Usanzimfura/Danny-Portofolio/blob/main/Employee_Attrition_Prediction.ipynb)
Used Classification modeling to Predict employee attrition at McCurr Health Consultancy to help reduce employee retention costs by limiting incentives only to employees who are at risk of leaving the organization.

# [Project 4. BellaBeat Wellness smart devices analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/udanny/bellabeat-capstone-google-analytics-certificate)
Used R to analyze Bellabeat smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, provided high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

# [Project 5. MovieLens Power BI Report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYTY3MjA4OGMtYTEzMi00N2E1LWJjYjYtYWZmMTE5ZTZiNWZkIiwidCI6ImUyOTM5MDk5LWQ4OTQtNGQ3MC1iNjFlLTdiYTgzMWRjN2RkYSJ9&pageName=ReportSection)
Created an interactive Power BI report of MovieLens, an entertaiment company which needs insights on characteristics of the classic movies, user interests and the relationship between user demographics and movie ratings. 

# [Project 6. Insight on World Health and Economics in the past 5 decades](https://www.kaggle.com/code/udanny/insight-on-world-health-and-economics)
 To challenge the misconception of many people who think that the world is sharply divided between prosperous, developed countries where everything runs smoothly and impoverished nations where everything is deteriorating, we analyzed the World Bank data provided by Gapminder, to explore health and economic trends over the past five decades to gain a more accurate picture of global progress.
